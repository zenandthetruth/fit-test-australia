However, a closer examination of publicly available information, including ASIC records and their own website, reveals no established presence until 2024. This significant timeline discrepancy raises serious questions about the accuracy of their stated history.</p><p>Adding to these concerns is a pattern of aggressive review reporting on their Google My Business profile. While businesses have the right to report reviews that violate Google's guidelines, the sheer volume of reported negative reviews suggests a strategy aimed at suppressing critical feedback. This raises questions regarding their commitment to transparency and open communication with clients.</p><p>The lack of verifiable records prior to 2024, coupled with the apparent suppression of negative reviews, presents a complex picture. Were they operating under a different name, or without a registered business name and ABN, potentially misleading customers in the process? Or are their current claims about their history simply inaccurate?</p><p>To ensure transparency and provide a comprehensive record of customer experiences, we are creating an archive of all negative reviews received by Fit Test Australia. This archive will serve as a permanent record, capturing negative feedback, regardless of whether the original reviews remain visible on Google My Business.<br><br>We believe that open and honest feedback is essential for building trust and fostering accountability. By archiving these reviews, we aim to provide a valuable resource for individuals and organizations seeking fit testing services.</p><h2>Fit Test Australia - Toorak Reviews</h2><p><strong>David R - Captured on 28 Feb 2025</strong></p><figure class="post__image"><img loading="lazy" src="https://truthaboutfittest.com/media/posts/12/Screenshot-2025-02-28-at-10-06-45-fit-test-australia-Google-Search.png" alt="I'm writing this review as a warning to others after having the misfortune of dealing with Fit Test Australia.

We hired them for a simple mask test, and they completely screwed it up from the start. The communication was a mess, and instead of owning their mistake, they pretended like it didn't exist. They tested us with the wrong mask-despite having last year's results (P2P) on file. Basic due diligence? Clearly not in their vocabulary.</p><p>Then there's <a href="https://truthaboutfittest.com/michal-morgan-from-fit-test-australia-chooses-to-spread-falsehoods-even-when-confronted-with-the-truth/">Michael</a>, who was an absolute disgrace to deal with. He acted like an arrogant, condescending prick the entire time and refused to admit fault, even though it's glaringly obvious they dropped the ball. Now, we're wasting more time and money getting the entire team retested because of their incompetence.<br>FTA's lack of accountability is shocking, and their refusal to correct their own errors is downright pathetic. If you want to deal with a company that actually cares about your business and gets the job done right, stay the hell away from FTA. This was an absolute disaster from start to finish.</p><p>Further investigation reveals a pattern of targeted review removal, with numerous negative reviews originating from Randwick and Fairfield Heights having been reported and subsequently removed from their Google My Business profile. This localized censorship raises specific concerns about Fit Test Australia's willingness to address customer feedback from these areas. The concentration of removed reviews suggests a deliberate strategy to control the narrative and suppress negative experiences from these communities, potentially denying potential clients in those locations access to a complete and unbiased understanding of their services.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on March 3, 2025</p></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><a href="https://truthaboutfittest.com/fit-test-australia-director-rebekah-mccutcheon-threatens-extortion-and-public-smear-campaign/" title="Rebekah McCutcheon">Rebekah McCutcheon</a> | <a href="https://truthaboutfittest.com/michal-morgan-from-fit-test-australia-chooses-to-spread-falsehoods-even-when-confronted-with-the-truth/" title="Michal Morgan">Michal Morgan</a> | <a href="https://truthaboutfittest.com/">Fit Test Australia</a> | All rights reserved.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://truthaboutfittest.com/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://truthaboutfittest.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
