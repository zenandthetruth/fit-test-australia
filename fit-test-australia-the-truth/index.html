This is a common occurrence in business, and there is no reason for resentment.</p><p>However, it is unexpected and unprofessional for the potential client to leave a scathing negative Google review that is both inaccurate and unprofessional. This is especially egregious after they have misappropriated intellectual property, wasted hours of your time, and are not even your client. While they were at it,they also attempted extortion and blackmail.</p><p>Unfortunately, this is exactly what happened with <a href="https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia">Fit Test Australia Pty Ltd</a> (FTA). Their actions were neither fair nor truthful, and we have the evidence to support this.</p><p><a href="https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia">Fit Test Australia</a> operates three locations – Randwick NSW 2031, Toorak VIC 3142 &amp; Fairfield Heights NSW 2165.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fit Test Australia’s Initial Engagement</h2><p>Fit Test Australia’s director, <strong>Rebekah McCutcheon</strong>, first interacted with our company on July 3, 2023. This interaction was initiated by Ms. McCutcheon, who had downloaded and reviewed various company materials, including playbooks and research documents. Her engagement with this content indicated a genuine interest in our company. We had not previously contacted Fit Test Australia directly.</p><p>Subsequently, between July 3 and December 8, 2023, our senior strategist participated in numerous calls with FTA to address their inquiries and discuss their requirements. Despite this ongoing dialogue, a strategy session was not scheduled until December 13, 2023, with the session itself occurring the following day, December 14.</p><p>After months of back and forth, we finally presented our strategy session and proposal to Fit Test Australia. It was a thorough and thoughtfully planned presentation designed to address their specific needs. Hours of research and careful deliberations were made to craft the perfect strategy for them and a plan to market their business. We met with them on 14th December 2023. From 15 December 2023 to 30 January 2024, we attempted to reach out for feedback, but our attempts were consistently ignored. Our calls went unanswered, and messages were left without a response.</p><p>Then, on <strong>30 January 2024</strong>, there was a breakthrough. We engaged in a brief conversation, lasting nine minutes and 50 seconds. This led to six more calls, culminating in a 17 minute and 41-second discussion on 6 February 2024, where FTA sought additional insights and specific details about our approach. Extensive feedback was sought and provided, including the specific details of how the strategy would be executed. The projected outcomes were covered in minute detail. This level of detail is rarely sought, but some potential clients prefer to be thorough.</p><p>On <strong>16 February 2024</strong>, after another brief conversation, we shared an updated proposal based on their requests. More conversations followed. Finally, on 8 March 2024, after months of back and forth, FTA disclosed that they had chosen to move on with another service provider.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Fit Test Australia Leaves a Negative Review</h2><p>After several months without communication from Fit Test Australia, on December 13, 2024, FTA’s director, Rebekah McCutcheon, contacted our employee via LinkedIn. She inquired whether our company was providing SEO services to their competitors, <strong>approximately 12 months after the initial consultation</strong>.</p><p>Our employee responded promptly and transparently, stating that he had not approached any competitors discussed after FTA decided not to proceed with our services. He acknowledged the possibility that one of his colleagues, given our broad client base, might have engaged a company in FTA’s industry. The employee expressed willingness to discuss the matter further or explore potential support.</p><p>The exchange between our employee and Rebekah was private and confidential. However, on January 20, 2025, an individual identified as “M” posted a negative Google review containing details that mirrored the confidential discussion between our strategist and Rebekah.</p><p>On the same day, we contacted Rebekah directly to resolve the issue. In an email, we clarified that we did not approach or work with the competitors she mentioned in her confidential chat. We also clarified that we do not conduct outbound campaigns, as she alleged. <strong>Subsequently, she revealed that she had not left the review; rather, her business partner, <a href="https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/michal-morgan-from-fit-test-australia-chooses-to-spread-falsehoods-even-when-confronted-with-the-truth/">Michal Morgan</a>, had done so.</strong> It is important to note that we have never had any interaction or direct conversation with Michal Morgan from Fit Test Australia.</p><p>Furthermore, she stated that if the review had been written from an account called “Fit Test Australia,” then she would have been the author.</p><p>We politely informed her that she was not a client of our business and requested that she ask her business partner to remove the review. We explained that her review was defamatory in nature, as it did not provide any objective evidence and stated opinions as facts, and that we would consider our next steps.</p><p>At this juncture, we were reasonably confident that the matter would be resolved; the defamatory review would be removed, and all parties could move forward. However, this was not the case. The situation escalated.</p><p>On January 22, 2025, after our numerous attempts to contact them and conclude the matter, we posted a negative review of Fit Test Australia (FTA) on Google. The review accurately reflected our negative experience, it did not represent our company’s values. Consequently, the post was removed that same day.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Rebekah McCutcheon from Fit Test Australia attempted extortion and blackmail on LinkedIn</h2><p>Unbeknownst to us, our employee, who was on holiday, received another message from Rebekah, the director of Fit Test Australia. As she and Michal Morgan have waived their rights to privacy by posting confidential information on Google reviews, a screenshot of the message she sent us is included below.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img loading="lazy" src="https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/media/posts/1//Rebekah-Fit-Test-Australia-1.png" alt="Rebekah Fit Test Australia" width="1500" height="395" sizes="(max-width: 1920px) 100vw, 1920px" srcset="https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/media/posts/1//responsive/Rebekah-Fit-Test-Australia-1-xs.webp 640w, https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/media/posts/1//responsive/Rebekah-Fit-Test-Australia-1-sm.webp 768w, https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/media/posts/1//responsive/Rebekah-Fit-Test-Australia-1-md.webp 1024w, https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/media/posts/1//responsive/Rebekah-Fit-Test-Australia-1-lg.webp 1366w, https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/media/posts/1//responsive/Rebekah-Fit-Test-Australia-1-xl.webp 1600w, https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/media/posts/1//responsive/Rebekah-Fit-Test-Australia-1-2xl.webp 1920w"></figure><p>Her ultimatum reads – “If you do not remove your attempt to shame my business with your 1-star review from a fake account, I will personally log into my Gmail account and leave you a review , and it will be much worse than the one this M person left you</p><p>Nonetheless, I will also make a public post on LinkedIn to call Mojo Dojo, Raj, and yourself out if this is not resolved.”</p><p><strong>Note</strong>: This message was a significant factor in our decision to publish this blog post and serves as substantial evidence of the smear campaign currently being conducted against us. Consequently, after careful legal consideration, we have decided to publish this screenshot. It is never acceptable to threaten anyone on any channel, and we take great pride in protecting our employees.</p><p><strong>On January 22, 2025</strong>, we received another negative review. This time, the review had more serious consequences as it divulged confidential business information,pricing strategy and communications. The review was posted publicly under FTA’s official Google account. Rebekah McCutcheon did follow through on her blackmail. This review since has been removed by Google.</p><p><strong>On February 3, 2025</strong>, we received another negative review. More confidential and personal information has been divulged including private email conversation. The reviewer is “Michal Morgan” from Fit Test Australia.</p><h2 class="wp-block-heading">Our response to Fit Test Australia’s allegation</h2><p>One might presume that we are seeking retribution. After all, they say revenge is a dish best served cold. However, let us be clear, this is not about vengeance. It is about accountability.</p><p>We attempted to resolve this with FTA privately through civil and professional means. That was unsuccessful. We attempted to initiate contact in a civil manner over the phone. That was also unsuccessful.  Fit Test Australia has constantly pushed back on any contact and continued to run a smear campaign on our business publicly.</p><p>We take issue with three key aspects of how the FTA chose to navigate this situation.</p><p><strong>Firstly</strong>, the accusations made by Fit Test Australia are unfounded. We were accused of approaching their competitors with confidential information that they had shared.</p><p>However, when pressed, FTA was unable to name a single competitor that we had allegedly contacted. Instead, they chose to publicly disclose confidential business details themselves, committing the very act of which they accuse us. Furthermore, the LinkedIn message from Rebekah McCutcheon is both unprofessional and constitutes an extortion attempt. She readily threatens employees of our organization, including blackmailing them with the removal of reviews unless she writes more negative reviews.</p><p><strong>Secondly</strong>, the abrupt change in FTA’s behavior was unexpected. In the 15 years history of Mojo Dojo, we have never encountered a similar situation. It took Fit Test Australia twelve months to leave three negative reviews. It appears that they expect us to refrain from working with their competitors, despite having no established relationship with us. Their concern regarding our potential collaboration with their competitors is so substantial that they deemed it appropriate to leave two negative reviews on our profile. </p><p><strong>The irony of these negative reviews is not lost on us</strong>; we see them as positive validation of our effective strategies. These strategies are bothersome enough to FIT Test Australia that they feel compelled to leave negative reviews stating, “They work for our competitors.”</p><p><strong>Third</strong>, FTA misappropriated intellectual property. They did not only post defamatory reviews; they also implemented our strategies and ideas. In other words, they dismissed our work publicly while using it privately. This is an undeniable case of intellectual property misappropriation.</p><p>Our team dedicated over 13 hours of research, 12 hours of support work, and an additional 18+ hours of follow-ups– all at no cost to <a href="https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/">FTA</a>.</p><p>Providing a free consultation does not mean that we deserved to be taken advantage of. We were under no obligation to FTA, nor are we precluded from working with others. Respect and fairness are mutual.</p><p>The negative review from FIT Test Australia has not and will not affect our approach to business. We have presented the facts, and our commitment to integrity remains steadfast. Our goal is to deliver value and clarity to clients who acknowledge our invested effort; nothing more, nothing less.</p><p>We have finally decided to take these negative reviews from Fit Test Australia and convert them into a marketing campaign. We are creative people and this is what we do best. We look forward to releasing this campaign shortly.</p><p><strong>Update 6 – 7 February 2025</strong></p><p><strong><a href="https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/fit-test-australia-director-rebekah-mccutcheon-threatens-extortion-and-public-smear-campaign/">Rebekah McCutcheon</a> </strong>contacted our offices to lodge a formal complaint with the company’s managing director. An employee returned her call on 7th February and reminded her that, as a company director, she had legal and moral obligations to other businesses. It was explained that posting reviews without merit, including those containing bullying and harassment, is unacceptable.</p><p>When she was informed that we do not work with “Fit Test Victoria,” she further accused us, stating that the mention of “Fit Test Victoria” implied prior knowledge and contact. Unbeknownst to her, Michal Morgan, an employee of Fit Test Australia, her husband, had updated the competitor’s name on the review. When this was explained and she was advised to read the review, she excused herself, stating that she had “administrative work to attend to. That she did not have the time”</p><p>She refused to acknowledge that despite our verbal and written confirmations, she continued to believe that we were collaborating with her competitor. She further threatened to publicly denounce us in a LinkedIn post to her 19,000 followers. She has since carried out this threat; the attached LinkedIn post is evidence of this.</p><p>We are currently conducting an in depth investigation into reviews of Fit Test Australia and will shortly release a video detailing our investigation including any evidence of fake reviews.</p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="entry-wrapper"><div class="content__actions"><p class="content__updated">This article was updated on February 24, 2025</p></div></div></footer></article></main><footer class="footer"><div class="wrapper"><div class="footer__copyright"><p><a href="https://truthaboutfittest.com/fit-test-australia-director-rebekah-mccutcheon-threatens-extortion-and-public-smear-campaign/" title="Rebekah McCutcheon">Rebekah McCutcheon</a> | <a href="https://truthaboutfittest.com/michal-morgan-from-fit-test-australia-chooses-to-spread-falsehoods-even-when-confronted-with-the-truth/" title="Michal Morgan">Michal Morgan</a> | <a href="https://truthaboutfittest.com/">Fit Test Australia</a> | All rights reserved.</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg width="20" height="20"><use xlink:href="https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://zenandthetruth.github.io/fit-test-australia/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=ffcbea6c02c8178d10092962b235a5b0"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
